### Individual reflection (short written responses)

1. Positionality: Who are you in relation to your study system/communities? Name one way your training, language(s), or passport access could shape your research questions or interpretations. 

I exist in a privileged position as a student of a University in relation to the indigenous peoples that have traditionally studied ecological concepts.
My lived experience shapes how I interact with the world. My background of being born in Oregon and choosing to live here for the entirety of my life
at this point has shaped who I am as a person and how I interact with science in general. I am more likely to focus on local issues around me in Oregon
and I have to work within the history and logic that Oregon provides for those local issues.

2. Language & knowledge systems: Give one concrete step you could take this term to include non-English sources or local knowledge forms (e.g., oral histories, maps, artefacts) in your evidence base. Why that step? 

I question whether local knowledge could be found within mainstream scientific bases so I would like to search outside of mainstream knowledge sources to
find this local knowledge this term.

3. Historical context: Identify one colonial or post-colonial process that influenced the landscape/species you study. How might that history affect your hypotheses or sampling frame? 

I'm a social science student so my relationship to colonialism can be pretty different from ecology students. In sociology we are having to understand
if the social system or social structure we are studying is a product of colonialism/imperialism. This history affects how we study the social structure
in question and can move our hypotheses to be more critical of the social structure itself if we argue it is a product of this history.

4. Avoiding parachute science: Describe one design change that would move a hypothetical field study from extractive to reciprocal (planning, authorship, outputs, or funding flow). 

A design change that would move a study from extractive to reciprocal is to involve the local indigenous community in the study process. Involving the
local community gives insight from traditional sources that would not be shown without their involvement in the project.

5. Authorship & credit: Propose an authorship/acknowledgement plan for a collaborative project that fairly credits local experts and knowledge holders. What trade-offs might you face? 

Scientists typically rely on formal citations in footnotes or at the end of a paper to cite other scientists in their papers. In order to cite the knowledge
of local experts a scientist should instead cite their knowledge directly within the paper itself by naming the expert and where they can be found by others.
A trade-off faced could be one that is mentioned in the Trisos paper which is that the knowledge of the local expert is more likely to be taken less seriously
by the scientific community so your project might not be used by others in your field.

6. Ethical risks: Name a foreseeable harm (social, cultural, or ecological) your project could cause and a mitigation you would build in from day one. 

A harm could be if tradtional knowledge is ignored and is treated unfairly by the project. This could be mitigated by doing what was described in question 5,
where local knowledge experts are seeked out for the project and their knowledge is taken seriously.


**In-class discussion (small groups → whole class)**

A. Case study: “Who benefits?”:
Scenario: You have rapid funding to analyze biodiversity data collected in a Global South region and stored in a Global North repository. Internet bandwidth is limited for local collaborators.

Discuss:

- Minimum co-design steps you must take before analysis begins.

- How you will handle data access & sovereignty (permissions, embargoes, community review).

- A fair authorship and outputs plan (local language summary, data dashboards, capacity funding). 


B. Choose two of the reflection questions and synthesize you reflections to report back to the group.
